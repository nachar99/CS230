# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client The gaming Room already has a game Draw it or Lose it that only works on android and his primary goal is to make this game available on all platforms and devices by creating a Web Application that maintains the game's level of quality and consistency.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did a great job at comparing diferrent OS's to host the game , and delivered a document that does help the client with achieving his goals with this game.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML Diagram I think helps with understanding the diferrent classes functions and provides a raod map for developing the game's code.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would try to improve the 5.	Distributed Systems and Networks section.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I understood the client's needs to scale and grow his game by increasing its compatibility to more platforms and devices so I focused on recommendin him an OS system that can help us with that, Obviously this whole platform is based on the client's need and our job is to solve their business problems or enhance their business using technology so without listening to the business and their needs then there would not be any function to what we are doing.


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would first start by uunderstanding the client's needs and pay attention to the goals, I learned in this project how to research diferrent techniques and softwares and tools to find the best way to fulfill the client's goals.
